# Fylo dark theme landing page - Frontend Mentor

Hi there! Thanks for checking out this project! ðŸ‘‹ 

This is a solution for a **Frontend Mentor challenge** that consists on building a **landing page** that looks as close to the given design as possible. The goal is to improve my web layout skills by building a realistic project.

You can checkout the challenge details in the [Frontend Mentor page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd).

### How to run the project:

I chose to use the Adalab Starter Kit to work on this project, created using Node and Gulp. So first of all it is neccesary to have **[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)** installed in order to run it.

1. **Open the terminal** in the root folder of the repo.
2. **Install the local dependencies** using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```
1. **Start running the project** using the following command that will open a browser window that shows a live version of the page.


```bash
npm start
```
